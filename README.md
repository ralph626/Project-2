--- Why GoHome ---

This app was created to help those individuals who are looking to relocate by helping them do rent comparisons into the areas they are looking to move into. California's current housing climate inspired us to develop this app as we too could benefit from it as we seek a new place to GoHome to.

GoHome uses Rent Estimate's API which uses an algorithm to identify comparable properties and provide an estimated rent for any property in the US.
