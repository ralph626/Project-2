https://rapidapi.com/realtymole/api/realty-mole-property-api/

## Technology Used 

1. Nodemon: An NPM package that, when installed, will reset the server for you when changes in the script are detected. 

2. E-mail Check Invalid or Disposable Domain: API that verifies if an email is a legitimate domain or not, also verifies if the email is "disposable" or "spam"

3. Realty Mole Property API: API that pulls a list of similar properties from an address that you give it. It requires the following parameters:

Address: "123 Main Street, Hometown, CA",
Beds: # of Beds
Baths: # of Baths
Property Type: "Apartment, Single Family, Townhouse, Condo, Duplex-Triplex"
Square footage: Size of the property


## Functionality To Be Added In Future Patches

1. Display an error if an email like "ObviouslyFake@fake.com" is entered.
2. Allow User to delete their search history as they move on to other properties to compare.
3. On each search, also display the image of the properties that are being compared. 
4. Remove the "Log-in" and "sign-up" buttons from the nav bar after a user registers or logs on. 
5. Make the code to display the rental divs "DRY" and eliminate the repeating divs. 
6. Additional CSS to make the presentation cleaner



--- Why GoHome ---

This app was created to help those individuals who are looking to relocate by helping them do rent comparisons into the areas they are looking to move into. California's current housing climate inspired us to develop this app as we too could benefit from it as we seek a new place to GoHome to.

GoHome uses Rent Estimate's API which uses an algorithm to identify comparable properties and provide an estimated rent for any property in the US.

When a User logs in, they can begin to compare properties form there list
These searches are saved in the database, along with the user information.
